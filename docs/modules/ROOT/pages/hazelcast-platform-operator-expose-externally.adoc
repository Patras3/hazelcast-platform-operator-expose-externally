:description: In this tutorial, you'll connect to a Hazelcast cluster running in Kubernetes from outside of the Kubernetes environment.

== What You’ll Learn

{description}

== Before you Begin

* Up and running https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster
* Kubernetes command-line tool, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[kubectl]
* Deployed xref:operator:ROOT:index.adoc[Hazelcast Platform Operator]

== Introduction

There are two available options for Expose Externally feature of Hazelcast Platform Operator:

- *Unisocket* - client requests are load balanced between Hazelcast members.

- *Smart* - client connects to all members and sends requests directly to the members owning the data.

Let’s see both approaches.

== Unisocket

The first option is to use the `Unisocket` type. This option will use the standard Kubernetes mechanism that automatically load balances the traffic to Hazelcast members.

=== Start the Hazelcast Cluster

Run the following command to create the Hazelcast cluster with Expose Externally feature enabled using Unisocket type.

[source, shell]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: my-hazelcast
spec:
  exposeExternally:
    type: Unisocket
    discoveryServiceType: LoadBalancer
EOF
----

For `discoveryServiceType` you can use:

* `LoadBalancer` - will create an external `LoadBalancer` for discovery serivce;
* `NodePort` - will expose the discovery service via `NodePort`.


=== Verify the Hazelcast Cluster

Check the cluster status by running the following command.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get hazelcast my-hazelcast
NAME        STATUS    MEMBERS
hazelcast   Running   3/3
----

After verifying that the cluster is `Running` and all the members are ready (`3/3`), run the following command to find the discovery service address.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get service my-hazelcast
NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
my-hazelcast   LoadBalancer   10.43.240.23   35.240.113.74   5701:30218/TCP   65s

----

The field `EXTERNAL-IP` is the address of your Hazelcast cluster.

=== Connect Hazelcast Clients to the Cluster

Configure the Hazelcast client with the external address and disable smart routing to use the unisocket connection.

	cc := &config.Cluster
	cc.Network.SetAddresses("<EXTERNAL-IP>")
	cc.Unisocket = true
	ctx := context.TODO()
	client, err := hazelcast.StartNewClientWithConfig(ctx, config)
	if err != nil {

	}

import hazelcast

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
    cluster_members=["<EXTERNAL-IP>"],
    use_public_ip=True,
    smart_routing=False,
)
----

Now you can start the application.

Java::
+

[source, bash]
----
cd java-unisocket
mvn package 
java -jar target/*jar-with-dependencies*.jar
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
cd nodejs-unisocket
npm install
npm start
----
--

Go::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
cd go-unisocket
go run main.go
----
--

Python::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
cd python-unisocket
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
----
--

You should see the following output.

[source, shell]
----

Current map size: 10

== Smart Client

The second option is to use the `Smart` type. With this option, each Hazelcast member will be exposed with its own service (it can be either `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`). Hazelcast smart client is capable of mapping the given key with its owner member, which means that it sends the data directly to the member which contains the right data partition.

.Hazelcast Smart Client
image::smart.jpg[Hazelcast Smart Client]

=== Start the Hazelcast Cluster

Run the following command to create the Hazelcast cluster with Expose Externally feature enabled using Smart type.

[source, shell]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: my-hazelcast
spec:
  exposeExternally:
    type: Smart
    discoveryServiceType: LoadBalancer
    memberAccess: LoadBalancer
EOF
----

This will create the Hazelcast cluster and one `LoadBalancer` service for discovery and one `LoadBalancer` service for each pod.

For `discoveryServiceType` you can use:

* `LoadBalancer` - will create an external `LoadBalancer` for discovery serivce;
* `NodePort` - will expose the discovery service via `NodePort`.

For `memberAccess` you can use the following options:

* `LoadBalancer` - lets the client access Hazelcast member with the `LoadBalancer` service;
* `NodePortNodeName` - lets the client access Hazelcast member with the `NodePort` service and the node name;
* `NodePortExternalIP` - lets the client access Hazelcast member with the `NodePort` service and the node external IP/hostname.

=== Verify the Hazelcast Cluster

Check the cluster status by running the following command.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get hazelcast my-hazelcast
NAME        STATUS    MEMBERS
hazelcast   Running   3/3
----

After verifying that the cluster is `Running` and all the members are ready (`3/3`), run the following command to find the discovery service address.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get service my-hazelcast
NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)          AGE
hz-hazelcast   LoadBalancer   10.108.141.178   10.96.184.178     5701:31434/TCP   5m44s
----

The field `EXTERNAL-IP` is the address of your Hazelcast cluster.

=== Connect Hazelcast Clients to the Cluster

Configure the Hazelcast client to connect to the cluster external address.
